      <h2 id="Sportswear">Sportswear</h2>
      <p>With the right sportswear you can enjoy your workout even more. Why? Sportswear is made of materials (often a mix of polyester and elastane) that regulate heat and perspiration so that you can continue to train comfortably. Sportswear must breathe. You don't want to be exercising in a soaking wet shirt within 15 minutes. Materials such as polyester do not heat up and are moisture-regulating. The same goes for cotton, but it does get wet. In terms of material, the same applies to sports trousers as to sports shirts. You can choose from shorts, jogging pants and tights. With thights is meant compression pants that offer your legs extra support when running or a leg workout.
        After your workout you may want to put on an extra layer. Not to get warm, but because you want to keep the heat with you for a little afterburn. You burn some extra calories with it. And of course it is comfortable. In this case you take a soft fabric, cotton is a good option. You are always in the right place with a sweater or hoodie. Good shoes are a must for sports. It is important that you buy the right pair for the type of training you are doing. It is better to do strength training on appropriate training shoes.

      <p>Exercising is better when you listen to a rousing song. But what are you listening to? A workout playlist is so nice to stay motivated. On Spotify, more than 25 million of those playlists can be found, all created by users, and it shows which songs are the most popular. Globally, the top 10 looks like this:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Eminem – Till I Collapse</li>

      <h2 id="Healthy food">Healthy food</h2>
      <p>Exercise and sports can contribute to improving your fitness, growing your muscles and losing weight. Healthy food and drink help with this. f you want to specifically focus on increasing your muscle mass, the advice is to take a little more protein. This can be done, for example, with a combination of some extra cottage cheese or yogurt, a cup of milk, some chicken breast, tofu and an extra portion of nuts or beans. A higher protein intake than the protein requirement does not lead to more muscle growth. Excess protein is used as fuel or stored in the form of fat. This can cause an unwanted gain in body weight. As an athlete you also need sufficient carbohydrates in addition to the necessary proteins and fats. By eating carbohydrates you keep your glycogen stock up. This allows you to exercise longer.
        As a fanatic athlete you need more calories than someone who does not exercise. If you do not get enough energy through food and drink, this can be at the expense of your recovery capacity and your training.</p>
